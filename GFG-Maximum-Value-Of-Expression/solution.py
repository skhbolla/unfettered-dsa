        When i=j , the value of expression will be 0.
        Since the expression is in absolute terms , the result will 
        always be positive i.e greater than or equal to zero.
        
        Hence the cases where i=j can be safely ignored because 
        some other case will definitely produce zero or higher result.
        
        Code wise this can be acheived by running the inner loop from 
        i+1 to n instead of i to n (So i will never equal to j)'''

        |arr[i] - arr[j]| + (j - i)
        
        Why ??
        Since the term (i-j) is guarenteed to be negative ,
        |i-j| will be the negative counterpart of the same
        i.e -(i-j) => (j-i)

    def fourth_optimization(self, arr : list[int]) -> int:
        ''' In the previous optimization, we were successful in
        removing the absolute bars for one of the terms..
        If we can remove the absolute bars from the other term too,
        we will be able to completely de-couple i and j terms...
        
        This will linearize the expression therefore our time complexity too...
        
        The term |arr[i] - arr[j]| only has two possible cases:
        arr[i] - arr[j] and arr[j] - arr[i]
        
        Therefore the possible cases of our expression become:
        (arr[i] - arr[j]) + (j - i)
        (arr[j] - arr[i]) + (j - i)
        
        Decouple and rewrite as :
        (arr[i] - i) + (j - arr[j])
        (arr[j] + j) - (arr[i] + i) 
        
        Rewrite again as :
        (arr[i] - i) - (arr[j] - j)
        (arr[j] + j) - (arr[i] + i) 
        
        So the question was to find the maximum of the expression,
        the solution is simply the maximum of above two terms
        
        solution = MAX ( (arr[i] - i) - (arr[j] - j) ,
                         (arr[j] + j) - (arr[i] + i) )
        
        
        To simplify let's just call :
        f1(x) = arr[x] - x 
        f2(x) = arr[x] + x
        
        The the solution becomes,
        
        solution = MAX ( (max f1 - min f1) ,
                         (max f2 - min f2) )
