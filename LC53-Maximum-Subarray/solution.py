        Bruteforce - Optimized bruteforce

        The problem in the previous bruteforce is:
        When we use list slicing , we are creating a shallow copy of the slice
        Since it is a shallow copy , python creates uses a contiguous block
        of k * 8 bytes in memory
            -> Where K is the length of the slice
            -> 8 bytes is the size of a pointer (reference) in 64 bit machines

        Every time your loop hits nums[i:j+1], the Python memory allocator
        requests a block of k * 8 bytes. Even though the slice is "destroyed"
        after sum() finishes, the Python Garbage Collector does not always
        return that memory to the OS immediately. It often keeps it in a
        "free list" for future allocations. This could cause a spike in RSS.

        Approach - Running sum

        The problem with bruteforce approach is ,
        to calculate the sum(nums[i:j]) we are walking the array from i to j
        for every pair of i, j we encounter ...

        But wait, why restart the summation from scratch for every 'j'?
        If we fix 'i', the sum of the subarray ending at 'j' is just
        the sum of the subarray ending at 'j-1' plus the new element.
        By maintaining this 'running sum', we eliminate the inner-most loop
        and linearize the summation process.

    def prefix_array_approach(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        '''
        Approach - Prefix arrays

        In the previous approach we are re-calculating sums for every
        different 'i'. While Running Sum is space-efficient, it doesn't
        "store" anything. If we needed to perform multiple Range Sum Queries,
        we'd be stuck walking the sub-array every single time.

        By using a Prefix Array, we precompute the cumulative sum from the origin
        for every index. We can find sum(nums[i:j]) = pa[j] - pa[i-1].

        So , we trade O(n) space to linearize our summation 'walk' into a O(1) query.

        *** [!IMPORTANT] Low-Level Trade-offs: ***
        Is this actually "better" than the Running Sum approach?
            Answer is a resounding **NO**

        This approach still uses the same outer 'i' loop and inner 'j' loop,
        but swaps the addition operations inside the inner loop with subtraction operations.
        Hence, the time complexity remains same.

        In a real-world scenario, this approach is technically "*worse*" for a
        Maximum Subarray problem because of the O(n) memory tax.

        By allocating a second large array (pa), we increase the risk of Cache Misses
        as the CPU has to fetch data from different segments of RAM.

        Running Sum (O(1) space) on the other hand wins on raw hardware performance because
        the CPU has to keep track of just one number (the running sum) in a single register.
